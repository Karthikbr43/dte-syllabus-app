Unit – II: Project Activities [CIE- 05 Marks]

1. Collect specification and prepare charts displaying symbols of semiconductor devices (At least 10 devices and at least 10 variants in each category).

<br><br>2. Open-ended activity like
<br>(i)	Obtain characteristics of a diode under simulated environment and determine knee voltage, forward and reverse dynamic resistance and PIV.
<br>(ii) Create a circuit to blink two LEDs alternatively with a noticeable delay.
<br>(iii) Any other such activities that can contribute for the student’s knowledge in respect of this course.

<br><br><b>Execution Mode</b>
<br><br>1.	Maximum of 4 students in each batch for project activity.
<br>2.	Project activity 1 and 2 are mandatory for every batch. 
<br>3.	Project activities shall be carried out throughout the semester and present the project report at the end of the semester. 
<br>4.	Report-size shall be qualitative and not to exceed 10 pages; one report per batch.
<br>5.	Each of the activity can be carried out off-class; however, demonstration/presentation should be done during laboratory sessions. 
<br>6.	Assessment shall be made based on quality of activity, presentation/demonstration and report.
