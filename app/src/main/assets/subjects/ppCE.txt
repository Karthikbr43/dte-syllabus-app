Unit V: Team Building and Leadership activity

<br>1.	Ask the participants to get inside a circle so that no one’s feet are touching theground outside of the circle. Once everyone has accomplished that task, the facilitator should applaud them and then remove 2-3 of the circles.Those participants who have lost their circle, now must join other circles. Again no feet can touch the ground outside of the circles.The facilitator continues to remove circles until only one is left. At this pointeveryone must try to fit their feet in the remaining circle. The more creative the solution, the better
<br>2.	Name of Activity: Balloon Towers-Instructions: Total group divides into smaller groups of 6-8 people. Each group is given 100 balloons and a roll of masking tape.The goal is to make a free standing tower (i.e. cannot attach off of ceiling, prop against wall, etc.) 
<br>3.	Give each group an identical bag of construction materials. This can include canvas tarp, construction materials, such as pipes and connectors or newspapers, tape and straws, or lots of amusing recycled junk that doesn’t necessarily have a name. Divide this equally so both groups will have identical supplies and put the supplies in paper bags.Using these materials each group must build half a bridge that begins on their side of the space and meets in the middle of the space with the other half of the bridge built by the other. Each half of the bridge must mirror the other exactly.Pace a tarp between the groups so they can’t see each other’s work. Groups must verbally communicate building techniques through the tarp so that they match and meet in the middle. They cannot touch the tarp. When groups think they have accomplished the task, remove the tarp and see how close they are. 
<br>4.	Name of Activity:See, Run, Do       ( Materials Needed: A completed poster,Posterboard,Scissors,Glue,Constructionpaper,Markers/crayons/pencilsPreparation)
<br>Decide on the concept you want to teach a group (example: 4-H fundraising, ommunication) Make a poster that represents that concept.Bring all supplies needed to reconstruct the poster and enough for teams of 4-5.Instructions: Post the poster outside the room where no one can see it. Divide the group into teams of 4-5. One person is going to be “seer” – only this person can see the poster and s/he must tell the runner what he sees. Another person is the “runner”  must run from the worktable to the seer.The rest of the team are the “doers” – must reconstruct the poster as the runner tells them, based on what the seer tells the runner.The runner can run as many times as necessary to get the correct information.
<br>5.	Objects are scattered in an indoor or outdoor place.  In pairs, one person verbally guides his/her partner, a blindfolded person, through the minefield.
<br>6.	Tie the tire 5-6 feet above the ground. It should be tied off in 3-4 directions sothat it does not move too much. The object of the game is for everyone to pass through the center hole of the tire as quickly as possible without touching the sides of the tire.The group must decide on two people who will be designated as the spotters; they are responsible for helping the first and last persons through the tire.Then the group should decide on a strategy that will get everyone through the tire quickly and safely.If anyone touches the side of the tire the group must start again. The facilitator should be the judge of this.
<br>7.	Beforehand, tie two pieces of string around the eraser end of a pencil,Ask everyone to find a 4 members group.Choose one of the groups, and ask the players to stand back to back.Tie the two pieces of string around their waists so that the pencil is hanging down between them.Place the bottle on the floor between them.Challenge them to lower the pencil into the bottle without using their hands
