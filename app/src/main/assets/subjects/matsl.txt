Unit – I: Tutorials and Practice

Tutorial
1.	Introduction
1.	Definition, need, and types of programming languages and their selection criterion. 
2.	Introduction to MATLAB/SCILAB (Features, capabilities and applications) and development environment.
3.	Program execution process.
4.	Program format.
5.	Concept and examples of built-in functions and the concept of toolboxes.
6.	Variables and constants: Definition, naming (identifiers or labels for different entities), initialization and accessing of variables. Constants and their representation.
7.	Data types-classification, memory requirement, range of values, usage and type specifiers. 
8.	Operators and Operands: Unary and binary operators. Arithmetic, logical, relational, combinational-assignment and special operators. Precedence and associativity.  Unary and binary operands.
9.	Statements-tokens and expressions. 
10.	Standard input and output statements and plot functions. 
11.	Escape characters.
2	Control structure
1.	Branching: Conditional (if, if-else, nested and ladder if-else, switch constructs) and unconditional (break, continue and go to statements). 
2.	Looping: Entry controlled (for and while).
3	Arrays/Matrices and strings 
1.	Definition, declaration, initialization (static and run-time or dynamic) and arrays, matrices and strings. 
2.	Accessing of strings, array and matrices elements and relevant operations.
4	Functions 
1.	Concept, advantages, classification, creation and application of                        functions.   
2.	Comparison of built-in, library and user-defined functions.




Practice
1.	Write program for the following problems (Assume right units. Search and use library functions wherever possible). Unless specified, built-in functions may be used if necessary.
1.	Display your country name. 
2.	Compute the area and circumference of a circle given the radius.
3.	Compute simple interest given the interest rate, principal and duration. 
4.	Compute compound interest given the interest rate, principal, compounding-nature and duration. 
5.	Swap contents of two variables without using intermediate variables.
6.	Factorial of a single digit number.
7.	Absolute value of a number.
8.	Largest of three numbers.
9.	Logarithm of a number.
10.	Y=sin(θ1+ θ2)+cos(θ1- θ2) given θ1and θ2in degrees.
11.	Average of N numbers read through keyboard (at run-time).
12.	Average of the numbers in 3x4 matrix.
13.	Plot discharging voltage across capacitor.
2	Analyze the program
Given the program or block of program (Matlab or Scilab), analyze the program and estimate/predict/record the output or error as the case may be. Instruct the student to justify the answer/output. 
[For e.g., A=246; B=-90; C=A+B*(10/A) +100; sprintf (‘%f’, C); in Matlab]
Such analysis should be carried out for all the concepts covered in this course.


Unit – II: Project Activities [CIE- 05 Marks]

Write the algorithm/flow-chart and code for the following problems (Assume appropriate data and units wherever necessary. Built-in functions can be used wherever necessary unless specified).
