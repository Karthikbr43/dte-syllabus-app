<br><br><b>Suggested Student Activity:</b>

<br><br>1. Identify the sensors/ transducers/actuators display devices used in various applications and prepare a hand written report comprising of its working principle.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> 

<br>1. Group of max four students should do any one of the above activity or any other similar activity related to the course COs and get it approved from concerned Teacher and HOD. 
<br>2. No group should have activity repeated or similar 
<br>3. Teacher should ensure activities by different groups must cover all COs 
<br>4. Teacher should asses every student by using suitable Rubrics approved by HOD
