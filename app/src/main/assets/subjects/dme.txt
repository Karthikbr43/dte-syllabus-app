<br><br><b>Suggested Student Activity:</b>

<br><br>1. The students should identify at least five machine components .He should select the materials for identified machine components by using design data hand book. List the mechanical properties of material selected.
<br>2. Observe the mechanisms where transmission of power takes place through shaft, Keys, coupling, pulley and belt drive. Get the required information regarding power transmitted (power output by motor engine etc.).
<br>3. The students can visit nearby workshops/garages and collect information like material, design features etc on different fasteners and machine components.
<br>4. Assignments on design of Screwed joints, Riveted joints [one each] With free hand sketches.
<br>5. The student should Download and present various presentations related to design of machine elements.
<br>6. The student should Download and present various presentations related to stresses in Machine elements.
<br>7. The student should Download and present various presentations related to failure of Machine elements.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> The activities or similar activities for assessing CIE (IA) for 5 marks (Any one)
<br>1. Each student should do any one of the following type activity or any other similar activity related to the course and before conduction, get it approved from concerned Teacher and HOD.
<br>2. Each student should conduct different activity and no repeating should occur
