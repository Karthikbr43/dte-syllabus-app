<br><br><b>Student Activity</b>

<br><br>1. 	Ask the students to bring two replaced Automobile/ Mechanical components, ask to select the instruments and measure the at least three dimensions. Record it in a sheet
<br><br>2.	Market Survey specific to properties of Various type of Materials used in Mechanical/Automobile industry or Any Engineering industries in local vicinity 
<br><br>3. 	Take the students for industrial visit for a nearby industry Select any two materials used for various mechanical engineering applications. Compare their mechanical properties

<b>Scheme of Valuation for SEE:</b>

<br><br>1.	Writing procedure: One experiment on (Mechanical testing) and One experiment on (Quality control) : 05+05=10
<br>2.	Conducting of Experiment : One experiment on Mechanical testing(Group of five)+ One experiment on Quality control (Individual) : 10+10=20
<br>3.	Calculation and results,(Both experiments) : 15+5=20
