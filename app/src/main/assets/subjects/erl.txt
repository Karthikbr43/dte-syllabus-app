Unit - I: Tutorials
Tutorial class for every graded exercise should include the followings.
<br><br>1.	Precautions to be taken during conduction of each exercise.
<br>2.	Proper tools to be used and sequence to conduct each exercise.
<br>3.	Any measurements/adjustments to be made in each exercise.
<br>4.	Discussion on trouble shooting of each system.

Unit - II: Lab exercises

1.	Diagnose the engine condition by analysing exhaust gas using smoke meter/ exhaust gas analyser and OBD II/ Engine analyser / scan tools.
<br>2.	Removing engine from vehicle, Cleaning, Dismantle cylinder head and decarburize.
<br>3.	Practice on Re-conditioning of valve mechanism –( Removing valve, valve seats and valve guides- Check for stem bend, Check the condition of valve spring , Measure the valve face angle , Recondition of valve using valve refacing machine & Cam Shaft).
<br>4.	Reconditioning of valve seat by using valve seat cutter kit/ vibro-centre kit & Valve lapping.
<br>5.	Check crack, warp-age in the cylinder head and practice surface grinding.
<br>6.	Measure the ovality and taperness of cylinder bore. 
<br>7.	Open ended exercise:
<br>8.	Remove cylinder ridge and dismantle the cylinder block parts & rebore the cylinder to next oversize.
<br>9.	Practice on Cylinder Honing using honing machine.
<br>10.	Servicing of Crank shaft, connecting rod and piston.
<br>11.	Assemble the engine by using specified torques.
<br>12.	Adjust valve timing and valve tappet clearance.
<br>13.	Setting of ignition timing, injection time and start the engine.
<br>14.	Open ended exercise

<br><br><b>Note:</b>
<br>1.	Open ended experiments have to be performed using the skills learnt in the Laboratory.
<br>2.	These experiments could be extended versions of the standard experiments.
<br>3.	Lecturer should know the end results of open ended experiments and only acts as a guide and students has to establish the procedure and conduct experiments.

<br><br><b>Examples : </b>
<br>1) Engine valve inspection.
<br>2) Various Simple tests to see if there are any leaks in the crankcase.
<br>3) Instant troubleshooting; most common problems and possible causes of engines.
