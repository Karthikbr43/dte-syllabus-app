Unit - I: CAD Commands Familiarization
Introduction to MCAD(parametric modelling) software-Understanding CAS technique, knowing the software interface, co-ordinate systems supported- Planes and their creation, reference axis, Sketch, Profile, basic commands related to 2D drawing.

Unit - II: Practice on Commands
Conversions of 2D profiles into 3D models-using extrude/protrude and revolve commands. Cut-outs/shell creation, placing holes, rounds/fillets, chamfers, creating rectangular and circular array/patterns, array/patterns along a path/curve, mirroring features,  editing of a model, creating internal and external threads. Adding draft, ribs, thin wall features, lip to models. Creating vents, boss. Creating swept and lofted models.
