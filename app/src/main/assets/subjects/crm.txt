UNIT I: Clay
Definition, formation of clays, classification – primary clays, secondary clays with examples. Impurities in clay like silica, alumina, calcium, magnesium, titanium alkalis, and carbonaceous material. Purification of clay – mechanical and chemical methods – sorting, sifting, air separation, washing, magnetic separation, froth floatation, electro osmosis. Plasticity – theories of plasticity (water of hydration theory, plate theory, colloidal theory, Molecular attraction theory, Fineness theory and interlocking theory) and measurement of plasticity. Effect of heat on clays.
