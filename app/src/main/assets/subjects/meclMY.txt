<b>Experiments:</b>

<br><br><b>PART – A: Mechatronics Lab</b>
<br><br>1. Design a PLC ladder diagram to construct an alarm system .
<br><br>2. Using PLC ladder diagram realize the following logic gates.
	<br>AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, EX-OR 
<br><br>3. Device a circuit that can be used to start a motor and then to start a pump after delay of 50s. Then the motor is switched off 10s before the pump is switched off when the pump remains on for 50s.
<br><br>4.There are 3 mixing devices on a processing line A,B,C.Afterthe process begin mixer-A is to start after 7 seconds elapse, next mixer-B is to start 3.6 second after A. Mixer-C is to start 5 seconds after B. All then remain ON until a master enable switch is turned off. Write PLC ladder diagram, timing diagram and realize the same
<br><br>5. The sub conveyors feed a main conveyor. The count from feeder conveyor is fed into an input register in the PLC. Construct a PLC program to obtain the total count of parts on the main conveyor. Use a time to update the total every 15 seconds. Design, construct, and test PLC circuits for this process
<br><br>6. Design a PLC program for the following real time applications.
<br>Ex:	
<br>i) Water level controlling
<br>ii) Drilling machine controlling
