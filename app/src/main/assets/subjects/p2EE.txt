<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<br><br>The objective of the project work is to enable the students in convenient groups of maximum of 5 members on a project involving theoretical and experimental studies related to the branch of study. Every project work shall have a guide who is the member of the faculty of the institution. Three periods per week shall be allotted in the time table and this time shall be utilized by the students to receive the directions from the guide, on library reading, laboratory work, computer analysis or field work as assigned by the guide and also to present in periodical seminars on the progress made in the project.

<br><br><b>TIME FRAME FOR THE PROJECT</b>
<br><br>1. Carry out a session or a seminar from the ISTE/IEI Student Chapter coordinator / Programme coordinator with the help of Innovation club / III cell for directing the students to identify project areas in the field of their interested including interdisciplinary areas. 
<br><br>2. Power point presentation in seminar should include detail description of project areas related to program,, Project report formats, developing personnel writing skills.
<br><br>3. The Students/Departments may at liberty to form the batch not less than 5 and maximum 8 and get registered with project coordinator/HOD through Project Proposal Performa (Appendix 8).at the end of V semester. 
<br><br>4. Students should take the approval from the Project committee/ Head of department for doing project.
<br><br>5. After approval the batch of students will be published in department notice board along with guide in the end of 5th semester.
<br><br>6. All students should finalize their Project immediately before commencement of SEE of 5th semester. 
<br><br>7. The types of project may include: 
<br>a) Industrial case study 
<br>b) Preparation of a feasibility report 
<br>c) Design and development of equipment.
<br>d) The overhauling of existing equipment 
<br>e) Creation of New facilities 
<br><br>8. The project should be challenging but manageable within the resources and time available. 
<br><br>9. Students should undergo reviews for three times in 6th semester during the internal assessment. Time table for IA should include project review; The guide should monitor the progress of Project work periodically and it should be finally evaluated for 25 marks at the end of 6th semester.  
<br><br>10.	The IA marks will be evaluated based on oral presentation and assessment by the internal guide by adopting Rubrics being developed by Project committee.
<br><br>11.	Real time problems, Industry related problems, should be chosen and it is a Responsibilities of the project committee / Programme coordinator/ Innovation club / I.I.T. cell to choose the appropriate project and to accept the Project Proposal
<br><br>12.	Identification of Topic: The selection of topic is of crucial importance. It should be field of interest. It is advisable to choose the project can be completed on time and within the budget and resources. The topic should be clear, directional, focussed and feasible. 
<br><br>13.	An outline of project proposal submitted & synopsis from student will initiate a dialogue between Student and Project coordinator who will then help you to work on the chosen topic and report.

<br><br><b>Fields identified for Project work</b>
<br>Each student may be assigned any one of the following types of project work:
<br>According to the local needs, the following major projects are suggested:
<br>The following areas may be chosen while selecting a project work:-
<br>1. PLC based
