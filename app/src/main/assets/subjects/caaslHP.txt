<br><br><b>Suggested Student Activity:</b>

<br><br>1. Ask the students to take the simple problems in Strength of Materials, analyze the stresses by using software.
<br>2. Ask the students to take the simple problems in Design of machine elements, analyze the stresses by using software.
<br>3. At least take two simple mechanical components likes step turned shaft, measure the dimensions, Apply loads and analyze for stresses.
<br>4. Study and understand the concept of theories of failure –Maximum shear stress theory, Maximum distortion energy theory ( Von-Mises Theory of failure)
<br>5. Identify the theory of failure for the brittle material and ductile materials
