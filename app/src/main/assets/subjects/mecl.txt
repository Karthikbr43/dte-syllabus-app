<b>Experiments:</b>

<br><br><b>PART - A: PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS</b>
<br><br>1. Design and Simulate the following digital circuits using MultiSim/any digital circuit simulator. Basic Logic Gates
<br>a) Basic Logic Gates
<br>b) Demorgan's Theorem
<br>c) Combination Logic
<br>d) Encoders and Decoders
<br>e) Flip-Flops

<br><br><b>PART - B: PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS(PLC)</b>
<br><br>1. Draw the ladder rungs to represent 
<br>a) Two switches Normally Open and both have to be closed for the motor to operate. 
<br>b) Either of the two Normally Open switches to be closed for the coil to be energised
<br><br>2.	Devise a timing circuit that will switch on for 20s and then switch it off.
<br><br>3.	Device a timing circuit that will switch on 10s and off 20s and so on.
<br><br>4.	Device a circuit that can be used to start a motor and then to start a pump after delay of 50s. Then the motor is switched off 10s before the pump is switched off when the pump remains on for 50s.
<br><br>5.	Devise a circuit that can be used with the domestic washing machine to switch on a pump to pump water for 100s into the machine. Then switch on a heater for 50s to heat the water. The heater is switched off and another pump is switched on to empty the water for 100s.
<br><br>6.	Design and simulate of fluid power circuits to control
<br>a) velocity
<br>b) direction of a single and double acting actuators
<br><br>7. Stepper motor interfacing with 8051 Micro controller 
<br>a) Full step resolution
<br>b) half step resolution
