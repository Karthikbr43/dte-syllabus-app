<br><br><b>Suggested Student Activity:</b>

<br><br>1. Prepare a power point presentation on applications of robot beyond the curriculum

<br><br><b>Note:</b> 

<br>1. Group of max four students should do any one of the above activity or any other similar activity related to the course COs and get it approved from concerned Teacher and HOD. 
<br>2. No group should have activity repeated or similar 
<br>3. Teacher should ensure activities by different groups must cover all COs 
<br>4. Teacher should asses every student by using suitable Rubrics approved by HOD
