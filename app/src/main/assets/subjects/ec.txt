<br><br><b>Suggested Student Activity:</b>
<br>The topic should be related to the course in order to enhance his knowledge, practical skill and lifelong learning, communication, modern tool usage. The following activities or similar activities for assessing CIE (IA) for 5 mark (Any one). Students are suggested to take up the following activities individually or in group not exceeding 5 students..

<br><br>1. Explain why the formula of sodium chloride is Nacl and the formula of calcium chloride is CaCl2.
<br>2. Both, oxygen and Diamond have same kind of bond, but they have really different properties. Look for their properties in the Internet and explain why they are so different.
<br>3. How do engineers use acids and bases?
<br>4. What metals are used most commonly to make expensive jewelry? Where are they found on the activity series? Why are these metals preferred for precious jewelry?
<br>5. Difference between oxidation and reduction?
<br>6. How can a light beam that passes through a sample of a given solution help determine its concentration?
<br>7. Identify and collect different adsorption and absorption material available in our environment.
<br>8. Calculate COD of a sample of water if 30 mL of the sample consumed 2.8 mL of 0.2 N potassium dichromate solutions?
<br>9. The permanganate method was the oldest method commonly used in the water industry for COD determination. Nowadays, the dichromate procedure is most widely used instead of permanganate method. Explaining why it is so?
<br>10. How do greenhouse gases keep us warm?
<br>11. As the earth warms, more water vapour is introduced into the atmosphere. Explain briefly how this can be viewed as both negative and a positive feedback for global warming.

<br><br><b>Note:</b>
