<br><br><b>Suggested Student Activity:</b>

<br><br>1. Student should implement phase diagrams and prepare some compositions of refractory and make a report on it.
<br>2. Visit a nearby refractory industry and make a report on the product manufactured.
<br>3. Arrange a guest lecture on refractories and student should make a report on the talk given.
<br>4. Surf the internet /books and gather information regarding recent developments in refractories and its application. And make a report on it.
<br>5. Visit a nearby industry using heat treatment, and make a report on the type & shape of the refractory they use.
<br>6. Make a report on availability of different shaped refractories in the market.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> Student should prepare hand written report with minimum 2-3 pages and reports should not be copied from earlier batches. And other similar tasks can be assigned.
