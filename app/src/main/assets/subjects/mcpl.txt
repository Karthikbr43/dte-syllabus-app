<br><br><b>OR</b>

<br><br>Develop ladder programs for any one of the following PLC based applications:
<br>01.	Automatic Traffic signal control.
<br>02.	Two signal lights flashing alternately at some time interval.
<br>03.	Automatic conveyor system- Example: when the ON button is pressed, the conveyor system starts running provided the object is sensed (when an object /load is placed on it) and reverses it direction after few counts of objects and continues to run in forward and reverse directions until OFF button is pressed or when objects are not loaded / sensed for, say10 secs.
<br>04.	Go Down lighting:- when one switch is pressed, the light in that section will be ON. When a switch is pressed in the next section , the light will be ON in that section and the light in the previous section will be OFF.
