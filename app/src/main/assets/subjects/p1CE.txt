<br><b>ROAD MAP FOR THE PROJECT</b>
<br><br>1. Carry out a session or a seminar from the project committee / Programme coordinator with the help of Innovation club / III cell for directing the students to identify project areas in any of their interested field, and even it may be of inter disciplinary. Power point presentation in seminar should include detail description of course, Project report formats, developing personnel writing skills.
<br>2. The students shall form their own batch not less than 4 and maximum 6 and get registered with project coordinator through Project Proposal Proforma (Appendix 7).Students should take the approval from the project committee for the project.
<br>3. After approval student should assign to the project guide in the beginning of 5th semester.
<br>4. Project should be finalized within a month (before first CIE) in the 5th semester.
<br>5. The types of project may include:
<br>a) Field study (empirical study).
<br>b) Statistical and case studies
<br>c) Experimental investigation,
<br>d) Computational work,
<br>e) Data collection and its analysis,
<br>f) Design oriented.
<br>g) Comprehensive case study (problem formulation, analysis and recommendations),
<br>h) Comparison of practices/ validation of theory/ method of testing, survey of quality Management practices
<br>The project should be challenging but manageable within the resources and time available.
<br>6. Projects already conducted in Survey camp should not be repeated.
<br>7. Projects of estimation of building should not be considered in as it appears in the student activities.
<br>8. Students should undergo reviews for three times in 5thsemester during the internal assessment and three times in6th semester during the internal assessment. Time table for IA should include project review; each review should be evaluated for 25 marks and average of 3 should be taken for both 5th and 6th semester.
<br>9. The IA marks will be evaluated based on oral presentation and assessment by the internal guide.
<br>10. Real time problems, Industry related problems, should be chosen and it is a Responsibilities of the project committee / Programme coordinator/ Innovation club / I II cell to choose the appropriate project and to accept the Project Proposal through Proforma (Appendix 7).
<br>11. Identification of Topic: The selection of topic is of crucial importance. It should be decided based on your understanding of the study, in the field and interest. The topic should be discussed with the Project Coordinator. It should be in harmony with your areas of interest and the specialization of the project supervisor. It is always better to identify a micro topic to remain focussed and complete the project on the time and with in the budget and resources. The topic should be clear, directional, focussed and feasible.
<br>12. An outline of your project proposal from your end & synopsis will initiate a dialogue between you and your Project coordinator who will then help you to work on the chosen topic and report.
<br>13. Student are advised to select project coordinator who are active professionals in the relevant area of the selected topic may be of any Programme/ Interdisciplinary/ other Institution/Industry approved by project committee/Innovation club/ I II cell.

<br><br><b>Abstract</b> – Abstract should be one page synopsis of the project report typed single linespacing, Font Style Times New Roman and Font Size 12. 

<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b> – The table of contents should list all material following it as well as anymaterial which precedes it. The title page and Bonafide Certificate will be listed in the Table of Contents but the page numbers of which are in lower case Roman letters. One and a half spacing should be adopted for typing the matter under this head. A specimen copy of the Table of Contents of the project report is given in Appendix 4

<br>7.	Future Enhancements / Recommendations
<br>8.	Summary

<br><br><b>Body of the project may include</b>-(Design/ Input Data/Structure/Questionnaire/Analysis/Solution/Sampling/Tools/Techniques/ Processing and Analysing Data)

<br><br>Each chapter should be given an appropriate title. Tables and figures in a chapter should be placed in the immediate vicinity of the reference where they are cited. Footnotes should be used sparingly. They should be typed single space and placed directly underneath in the very same page, which refers to the material they annotate. 

<br><br><b>Arrangement of Paragraph in a Chapter:</b>

<br><br>1.	Each paragraph in a chapter should be properly numbered for example, 2.1, 2.2 etc., where first digit represents the Chapter Number and second digit the paragraph number. There is no need to indicate the number for the first paragraph in a chapter.
<br>2.	Sub-paragraphs, if any indicated as 1.1.1, 1.1.2 etc. i.e. first digit representing the chapter, the second representing the paragraph and third representing the sub-paragraph.

<br><br>Don’t underline the headings or subheadings or side heading. Instead use the bold letters.

<br><br><b>Appendices</b> –Appendix showing the detailed data, design calculations, derivation etc, Appendices are provided to give supplementary information, which isincluded in the main text may serve as a distraction and cloud the central theme. Appendices should be numbered using Arabic numerals, e.g. Appendix 1, Appendix 2, etc. Appendices, Tables and References appearing in appendices should be numbered and referred to at appropriate places just as in the case of chapters.Appendices shall carry the title of the work reported and the same title shall be made in the contents page also. 

<br><br><b>Bibliography or List of References</b>– References should be numbered from 1st chapter to the last chapter in ascending order and should be shown in square brackets.The bibliography list should be made strictly in alphabetical order of the name of the authors.The listing of references should be typed 4 spaces below the headingREFERENCES”in alphabetical order in single spacing left – justified. The reference material should be listed in the alphabetical order of the first author. The name of the author/authors should be immediately followed by the year and other details.A typical illustrative list given below relates to the citation example quoted above. 

<br><br><b>[Chapter]Author Name, ‘Title of the book or paper’, Publisher name, (year), Page No</b>
