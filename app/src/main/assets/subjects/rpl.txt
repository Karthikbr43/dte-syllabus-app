<br><br><b>Suggested list of student activities:</b>

<br><br>1. Conduct a survey on the Big data and prepare a report of 3-4 pages on various softwares used for analyzing Big data.
<br>2. Using R concepts analyze the student result.
<br>3. Conduct a survey how Big data can use R programming for an enterprise.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> the following activities or similar activities for assessing CIE (IA) for 5 marks (Any one). Student activity like mini-project, surveys, quizzes, etc. should be done in group of 1-2 students. 
<br>1.	Each group should do any one of the following type activity or any other similar activity related to the course and before conduction, get it approved from concerned course co-ordinator and programme co-ordinator.
<br>2.	Eachgroup should conduct different activity and no repeating should occur.

<b>Scheme of Valuation for SEE:</b>

<br><br>1.	Writing  two programs : 10+10=20
<br>2.	Executing any one program with result : 20
<br>3.	Viva Voice : 10

<br><br><b>TOTAL = 50 Marks</b>
