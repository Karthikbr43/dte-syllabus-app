<br><br><b>Suggested Student Activity:</b>

<br><br>1. Carry out a Survey and Prepare a hand written report on the different PLC’s available in market.
<br>2. Students can make simulations of PLC applications beyond the curriculum.
<br>3. Prepare a hand written report on the various Sensors and Actuators used in the PLC Implementations.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> 

<br>1. Group of max four students should do any one of the above activity or any other similar activity related to the course COs and get it approved from concerned Teacher and HOD. 
<br>2. No group should have activity repeated or similar 
<br>3. Teacher should ensure activities by different groups must cover all COs 
<br>4. Teacher should asses every student by using suitable Rubrics approved by HOD
