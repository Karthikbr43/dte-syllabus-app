<br><br>7. Comparison of 32 bits and 64 bits OS
<br><br>8. Operating system is responsible for following activities in connection with management of memory:
<br>a) Allocation and de allocation of memory as and when needed
<br>b) Keeping track of used and unused memory space.
<br>c) Deciding what process to be loaded into memory in case space becomes available.
<br><br>9. For secondary space management:
<br>a) Swap space and free space management
<br>b) Disk scheduling
<br>c) Allocating space to the data and programs onto the secondary storage device.
<br><br>10. For process management:
<br>a) Creation, deletion of both user and system process.
<br>b) Handling process synchronization.
<br>c) Deadlock handling.
