<br><br><b>Suggested Student Activity:</b>

<br><br>1. Collect data on: (i) ARM variants (ii) ARM processor cores likeARM7, ARM9, ARM10, ARM11, SA and Cortex processors (iii)After collecting the data make compression between each.
<br>2. Prepare a report on pin functions of LPC2148
<br>3. Prepare a report on USB controller, UART, I2C, SPI, SSP and so on
<br>4. Prepare a report on ARM products, Embedded ARM applications.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> The activities or similar activities for assessing CIE (IA) for 5 marks (Any one)
<br>1. Every student should perform either one of the above activities independently as assigned by the teacher based on interest of the student. Student can also choose any other similar activity with a prior approval from the concerned teacher.
<br>2. Teacher is expected to observe and record the progress of students’ activities
<br>3. Assessment is made based on quality of work as prescribed by the rubrics table
