<br><br><b>QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS:</b>
<br>Volumetric Analysis by Titrimetric Method:-
<br>Volumetric Analysis – Titration - Standard solutions , concentration of solutions- normal, molar and molal solutions – decinormal, decimolar and decimolal solutions – indicators –acidbase indicators and redox indicators-selection of indicators – endpoint of titration –neutralization and redox reactions.
