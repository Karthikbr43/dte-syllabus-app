<br><br><b>Student Activity</b>

<br><br>1. 	Ask the students to bring two or three pieces of finished parts and inspect them by using above measuring instruments. 
<br>2. 	Make the average of above readings and check for accuracy with other students.   
<br>3. 	Take the students for industrial visit for a nearby industry, select any two finished parts to measure the dimensions  and Compare their accuracy.
