<br><br><b>Student Activity</b>
<br><br>1. 	Bring actual industrial production drawings from nearby industry and distribute them among group of students for self study and interpretation. Ask students to practice these drawings using any modeling software. 
<br><br>2.	Bring small real components like Nut-Bolt, Washers, Cotter-knuckle Joints, Couplings, and Pulleys in the class. Ask students to use Vernier caliper to measure the dimensions and formulate relations between them. Practice same relations with AutoCAD/Pro-E software/Solid edge/catia to draw 2D/3D models of these components.  
<br><br>3.  Take the students for industrial visit. Hands-on practice with drafting software to create a production drawing of an assembly.
