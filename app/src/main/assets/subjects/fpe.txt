UNIT – V: Basic pneumatic circuits
Circuit to actuate single acting and double acting pneumatic cylinders ,Circuit to control speed of a single acting and double acting cylinder,(meter in meter out),Pilot controlled double acting cylinder, circuit for Double acting cylinder to advance by actuation of a solenoid valve and it’s retract movements is delayed by time lag through a timer
<br><b>[08 Hrs] [15 Marks] </b>

UNIT – VI: Engineering applications of pneumatic system
Circuit to Press fit a pin to a hole with a pre-condition that while actuating of the cylinder, both the hands of the operator should be engaged (two handed safety circuits),A piston rod of a double acting cylinder is to extend when two 3/2 DC valves are actuated if one of the 3/2DC valve is released the cylinder returns to its initial position(AND function), A double acting cylinder extends if one or both 3/2DC valve are operated. If both 3/2 DC valves are released then cylinder retracts (OR function)
