<br><br><b>Suggested Student Activity:</b>

<br><br>1. Each student will select and bring at least one mechanical component. Sketch each component. Sketch and label main parts of instruments to be used. Calculate least count of the instrument/s to be used. Measure and record applicable dimensions of each component using suitable instrument
<br>2. Sketch the part and setup, list the instruments used, list the steps followed and record the observations for checking straightness
<br>3. Select appropriate limit gauge for given dimension/part and check the dimension with gauge.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> The activities or similar activities for assessing CIE (IA) for 5 marks (Any one)
<br>1. Each student should do any one of the following type activity or any other similar activity related to the course and before conduction, get it approved from concerned Teacher and HOD.
<br>2. Each student should conduct different activity and no repeating should occur
