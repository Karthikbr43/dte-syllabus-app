<br>2.	Program to generate a 50% duty cycle, 1 KHz wave and to use it for exciting a buzzer.
<br>3.	Program to blink a group of 8 LEDs with a delay.
<br>4.	Switching interface
<br>5.	Interface 4-digit seven-segment display to display any four letter word.
<br>6.	Interface stepper motor and control its speed and direction.
<br>7.	Interface DC motor and control its speed using PWM.
<br>8.	Interface 2-line LCD module to output a moving message on it.
<br>9.	PWM module program for LPC2148, to demonstrate single edge PWM generation.

<br><br><b>Execution Mode</b>
<br>1.	Every student should perform Project activity independently as assigned by the teacher based on interest of the student. Student can also choose any other similar activity with a prior approval from the concerned teacher.
<br>2.	Project activities shall be carried out throughout the semester and present the project report at the end of the semester. 
<br>3.	Report-size shall be qualitative and not to exceed 6 pages; 
<br>4.	Each of the activity can be carried out off-class; however, demonstration/presentation should be done during laboratory sessions. 
<br>5.	Assessment shall be made based on quality of activity, presentation/demonstration and report.
<br>6.	Assessment is made based on quality of work as prescribed by the following rubrics table.

<br><br><b>Institutional Activity (No marks):</b>
<br>The following are suggested institutional activities, to be carried out at least one during the semester. The course teacher/coordinator is expected to maintain the relevant record (Containing, Activity name, Resource persons and their details, duration, venue, student feedback, etc) pertaining to Institutional activities

<br><br>1.	Organize hands-on practice on design and simulation of H/W interfacing
<br>2.	Motivate the student to take case study on different applications on LPC2148.
