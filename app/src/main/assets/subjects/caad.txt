UNIT I: Introduction to Machine Drawing
Requirements of machine drawing, drawing views – front – top - side, section plane, sectional views – full – half – local -  partial – revolved – removed – offset, conventions of section lines, conventional representation of machine parts, production drawing – tolerance – hole basis system – shaft basis system,  limits – upper – lower, fits – clearance fit – interference fit - transition fit, surface roughness – representation of surface roughness on drawings, assembly drawing – types – sequence of preparing assembly drawing.

UNIT II: Computer Aided Drafting
Information about CAD – comparison between manual drawing and CAD – advantages of using CAD –areas of applications, System requirements for CAD. Setting drawing area - coordinates – units - limits – grid – snap – Osnap – Ortho mode.

UNIT III: Drawing Entities
Draw/sketch tools- point – line – construction line – circle – arc – polygon – poly line – hatch – text – ellipse – rectangle – spline – donut – modifying/changing entities properties.

UNIT IV: Modifying Entities
Modify / Edit tools – erase – copy – array – move – mirror – offset – rotate – scale – stretch – trim – extend – break – explode – join – chamfer – fillet. 

UNIT V: Assembly Drawing
Drawing detailed parts drawings – assembling the parts – drawing sectional front view –drawing top/side view.

UNIT VI: Dimensioning and Printout
Dimension the assembly in different views– setting the drawing for printing – printout.

<br><br><b>Note:</b>
<br>1. each drawing should be drawn with proper border, title block and bill of materials.
<br>2. Detailed drawing sheets should be provided to students, students have to draw detailed drawings first then assembly drawing has to be drawn.
