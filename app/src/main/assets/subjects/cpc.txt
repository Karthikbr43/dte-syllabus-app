<br><br><b>Suggested Student Activity:</b>

<br><br>1. Student should find various glaze compositions for different ceramic products and make a comparative report on their qualities.
<br>2. Students should collect / (given formula/recipe of) three different glaze formula or percentage composition of known products and convert them to percentage glaze compositions or glaze formula and submit the report.
<br>3. Make a report on modern instruments used in finding moisture content of material.
<br>4. Make a report on any other methods of finding density of slurry in industry.
<br>5. Make a report on instruments used in finding mechanical strength of ceramic products.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> Student should prepare hand written report with minimum 2-3 pages and reports should not be copied from earlier batches. And other similar tasks can be assigned.
