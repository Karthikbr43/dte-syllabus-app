Unit - I: CAD commands familiarization and  practice  related to 3D, Assembly
Understanding parametric modelling technique, knowing the software interface, co-ordinate systems supported- Planes and their creation, reference axis, Sketch, Profile, constraints-geometrical and dimensional, need for constraining, fully constrained, under constrained, over constrained.
<br>Conversions of 2D profiles into 3D models-using extrude/protrude and revolve commands. Cut-outs/shell creation, placing holes, rounds/fillets, chamfers, creating rectangular and circular array/patterns, array/patterns along a path/curve, mirroring features,  editing of a model, creating internal and external threads. Adding draft, ribs, thin wall features, lip to models. Creating vents, boss. Creating swept and lofted models.

<br><br><b>Student Activity</b>

<br><br>1. 	Bring actual industrial production drawings from nearby industry and distribute them among group of students for self study and interpretation. Ask students to practice these drawings using any modeling software. 
<br><br>2. 	Bring small real components like Nut-Bolt, Washers, Cotter-knuckle Joints, Couplings, and Pulleys in the class. Ask students to use Vernier caliper to measure the dimensions and formulate relations between them. Practice same relations with AutoCAD/Pro-E software to draw 2D/3D models of these components.  
<br><br>3. 	Take the students for industrial visit. Hands-on practice with drafting software to create a production drawing of an assembly.

<b>Scheme of Valuation for SEE:</b>

<br><br>1.	Create the model and drawing views 3D  along with dimensions and annotations as per sketch given (unit-II) : 15
<br><br>2.	Create the assembly model and drawing with dimension, BOM, - as per the given sketch (Compulsory Question to be asked in end exam) : 35
