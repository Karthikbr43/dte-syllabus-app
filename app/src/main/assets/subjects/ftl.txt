<br><br><b>Student Activity</b>

<br><br>1.	Student should visit a nearby industry and prepare report on furnaces /kiln they are using mentioning its available technical details.
<br><br>2.	Student should prepare a report on lab model furnace wiring diagram with its technical details.
<br><br>3.	Student should design (sketches / prototype models) a different furnace or kiln model useful for industries and make documentation of the work.
<br><br>4.	Student should carry maintenance work of drier / furnace / kiln provided in the laboratory and prepares their personal report in their words.
<br><br>5.	Student should design (paper work or prototype) a lab model furnace and make a report on it.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> Any one of the activity can be assigned to student to perform. And they have to submit handwritten report with 2-3 pages. And can attach photos/ charts where ever applicable. Reports should not be copied from earlier batches. And other similar tasks can be assigned.
