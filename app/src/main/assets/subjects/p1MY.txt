<b>INDUSTRIAL VISIT</b>
During the program of study all the students are required to visit the industries anywhere in India after completion of the fifth semester. Students can visit any industry as per the requirement to achieve the program outcomes. After visiting the industry, they are required to submit the report on visit to the head of the department of the program. The permission letter from the industries is not mandatory (due to the industries busy schedule and time concern). Students will visit the available industries at the time of their visit to that place.
