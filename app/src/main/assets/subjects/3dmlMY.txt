<b>CONTENTS:</b>

<br><br>1. Introduction to Machine Drawing-Multi view drawing, Projection System, Drawing Standards-ISO, ANSI, BIS, Introduction to Parametric Modeling software-Understanding parametric modeling technique, knowing the software tools.
<br>Define and understand the following terms:
<br>Planes and their creation, reference axis, Sketch, Profile, constraints-geometrical and dimensional, need for constraining, fully constrained, under constrained, over constrained.

<br><br>2. Part Modeling:
<br>Conversions of 2D profiles into 3D models-using extrude/protrude and revolve commands. Cut outs/shell creation, placing holes, rounds/fillets, chamfers, creating rectangular and circular array/patterns, array/patterns along a path/curve, mirroring features, editing of a model, creating internal and external threads. Adding draft, ribs, thin wall features, lip to models. Creating vents, boss. Creating swept and lofted models.

<br><br>Using part modeling techniques create the Part Models and learn how to generate different Drawing views:
<br>Front View
<br>Top View and Side/Profile view.

<br><br>3. Assembly Modeling:
<br>Know the assembly environment, setting the assembly environment, Types of assembly design approach-bottom-up and top-down assembly. 
<br>Creating assembly and sub-assemblies
<br>Editing and modifying assembly relationships 
<br>Creating exploded view of the assembly, Knowing the concept about Bill of Materials, Understand the detail drawing. 
<br>Know the procedure for revision of drawing 

<br><br>4. Using assembly modeling techniques create the following:
<br>•	Hexagonal Nut and Bolt
<br>•	Solid Muff Coupling
<br>•	Knuckle Joint
<br>•	Socket and Spigot joint
<br>•	Plummer Block
<br>•	Screw Jack
