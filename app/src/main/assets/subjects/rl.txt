<br><br><b>Student Activity</b>

<br><br>1.	Student should prepare a refractory batch of their own and give a shape useful in laboratory, fire the same and make report on it.
<br><br>2.	Visit a nearby refractory industry and make a report on the refractories manufactured there in the industry.
<br><br>3.	Visit a nearby industry and make a report on refractories used in heat treatment process if any.
<br><br>4.	Arrange a guest lecture on refractories and student should make a report on the talk given.
<br><br>5.	Surf the internet and find various shapes of refractories and make report on their possible shaping methods.
<br><br>6.	Surf the internet for various industrial refractories and make a comparative report on their properties and applications.
<br><br>7.	Surf the internet /books and gather information regarding the refractories used in metallurgical/ glass/ sugar/ chemical/ fertiliser industries.   

<br><br><b>Note:</b> Student should prepare hand written report with minimum 2-3 pages and reports should not be copies from earlier batches. And other similar tasks can be assigned.
