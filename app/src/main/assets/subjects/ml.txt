Unit - I: Tutorials and Graded Exercises

<b>Practicing Exercise</b>
<br>1.	Identification of program development tools and familiarization of program development using such tools.

<br><br><b>Basic experiments (Use ALP and embedded C on simulators or kits)</b>
<br>2.	Data movement: 
<br>(a) Move a block of data within internal RAM 
<br>(b) Exchange a block of data between internal RAM  and external memory
<br>3.	Arithmetic operations: 
<br>(a) Evaluate simple arithmetic expression such as y = (((5*2)-(4+1))/3)%2.
<br>(b) Addition of three 8-bit BCD numbers to result in BCD form.
<br>4.	Logical operations: 
<br>(a) Evaluate simple logical expression such as Y = aandandb||c^!d where a, b, c and d are 8-bit data
<br>(b) Rotation or shift operations on 16-bit data
<br>(c) Convert data to even-parity in a block of internal RAM
<br>5.	Code conversions 
<br>(a) Packed BCD to unpacked BCD and vice-versa
<br>(b) BCD to binary and vice-versa
<br>(b) BCD to ASCII and vice-versa
<br>6.	Program to search a given 8-bit number in an array of N numbers
<br>7.	Program to sort N 8-bit numbers.
<br>8.	Program to count the number of ones and zeros in the data saved in two consecutive memory locations
<br>9.	Program to clear all the bytes (stored in internal RAM) which have odd-parity
<br>10.	Program to toggle a particular bit in the internal RAM with the delay of N ms given the clock frequency f MHz with the use of delay subroutine.

<br><br><b>Interfacing experiments (using embedded C and microcontroller boards)</b>
<br>11.	Program to toggle the LED with tone using push-button switch.
<br>12.	Program to display the value of analog voltage interfacing ADC or any digit pressed in an hex-key pad on LCD display
<br>13.	Program to control direction and speed of a stepper motor.
<br>14.	Program to generate DTMF telephone tones; use push-button switch to trigger the tone.
<br>15.	Program to generate sine, rectangular and triangular wave-forms.
<br>16.	Program to control traffic lights.

Unit – II: Project/Student Activities [CIE- 05 Marks]

1. Three open-ended experiments of assembly language programs/embedded C other than programs 2 to 10 mentioned above are to be assigned by the teacher (Student is expected to solve and execute/simulate independently).
