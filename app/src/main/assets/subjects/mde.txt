<br><br><b>Suggested Student Activity:</b>

<br><br>1. The students should identify at least five applications .He should select the materials for identified applications by using design data hand book. List the mechanical properties of material selected.
<br>2. Observe the system where transmission of power takes place through shaft, Keys, coupling, pulley and belt drive. Get the required information regarding power transmitted (power output by motoror engine etc.). By selecting suitable materials, design the shaft, key and coupling.
<br>3. Assignments on design of Helical Springs, Screwed joints, Riveted joints [one each] with free hand sketches.
<br>4. The student should Download and present various presentations related to design of machine elements
<br>5. The student should Download and present various presentations related to stresses in machine elements.
<br>6. The student should Download and present various presentations related to failure of machine elements.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> The activities or similar activities for assessing CIE (IA) for 5 marks (Any one)
<br>1. Each student should do any one of the following type activity or any other similar activity related to the course and before conduction, get it approved from concerned Teacher and HOD.
<br>2. Each student should conduct different activity and no repeating should occur
