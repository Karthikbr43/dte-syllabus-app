Unit III: Part modeling tools
Conversions of 2D profiles into 3D models-using extrude/protrude and revolve commands. Cutouts/shell creation, placing holes, rounds/fillets, champers, creating rectangular and circular array/patterns, array/patterns along a path/curve, mirroring features,  editing of a model, creating internal and external threads. Adding draft, ribs, thin wall features, lip to models. Creating vents, boss. Creating swept and lofted models.

Unit IV: Assembly modeling and drafting tools
Know the assembly environment, setting the assembly environment, types of assembly design approach-bottom-up and top-down assembly, Creating assembly and sub-assemblies, Applying assembly relationships, Editing and modifying assembly relationships, interference detection in assemblies.
<br>Drafting environment-drawing views-types-options-generating each type of view-adding annotations-Creating exploded view of the assembly-creating balloons and parts list.

<br><br><b>Suggested Student Activity:</b>

<br><br>1.	Students can visit Computer coaching centers/CAD Centers/ websites and collect information on different paid and FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) CAD/CAM/CAE software with their features and applications.
<br>2.	Students can visit computer coaching centers /CAD Centers/ Websites and collect information on new type of part modeling /assembly modeling tools or other work benches like surface modeling, sheet metal, plumbing, electrical etc.
<br>3.	Students can visit websites of different CAD/CAM/CAE software and collect information on the process  to download trial or student version software.
<br>4.	Students can create simple mechanical/Automobile mechanisms using Animation/mechanism  workbench.
<br>5.	Students can find stress/strain induced in many Simple strength of Materials problems using FEM workbench.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> The activities or similar activities for assessing CIE (IA) for 5 marks (Any one)
<br>1.	Student should prepare a report on any one of the above/similar activity, which helps in achieving above course outcomes.
<br>2.	The report prepared should be approved by the concerned staff and HOD.
<br>3.	The activity group should consist of maximum of three students. 

<br><br><b>LAB EXERCISES </b>

<br><br><b>Note:</b>
<br>1.	Each drawing should be created with proper border, title block and bill of materials.
<br>2.	Detailed drawing sheets should be provided to students.
<br>3.	The following drawings should be created after creating respective part models and assemblies.
<br>4.  Software: Any Genuine CAD software or free and open source CAD software.

<br><br><b>Note:</b>
<br>1.	Open ended experiments have to be performed using the skills learnt in the Laboratory.
<br>2.	These experiments could be extended versions of the standard experiments.
<br>3.	Lecturer should know the end results of open ended experiments and only acts as a guide and students has to establish the procedure and conduct experiments.
<br>4.	Example for Open ended experiment-I are Part model of bevel gear, hypoid gear, pinion, rack and cylinder head etc.
<br>5.	Example for Open ended experiment-II is Assembly models of Clutch plate, wheel cylinder and injector.
