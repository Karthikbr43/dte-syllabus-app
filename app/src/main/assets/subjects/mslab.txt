<br><br><b>2.	Control structure</b>

<br>2.	Looping: Entry controlled (for and while).

<br><br><b>3.	Arrays/Matrices and strings</b>
<br>1.	Definition, declaration, initialization (static and run-time or dynamic) and arrays, matrices and strings. 
<br>2.	Accessing of strings, array and matrices elements and relevant operations.

<br><br><b>4.	Functions</b>
<br>1.	Concept, advantages, classification, creation and application of functions.
<br>2.	Comparison of built-in, library and user-defined functions.

<br><br><b>Practice:</b>

<br><br><b>1.	Write program for the following problems (Assume right units. Search and use library functions wherever possible). Unless specified, built-in functions may be used if necessary.</b>
<br>1.	Display your country name.
<br>2.	Compute the area and circumference of a circle given the radius.
<br>3.	Compute simple interest given the interest rate, principal and duration. 
<br>4.	Compute compound interest given the interest rate, principal, compounding-nature and duration.

<br>9.	Logarithm of a number.
<br>10.	Y=sin(θ<sub>1</sub>+ θ<sub>2</sub>)+cos(θ<sub>1</sub>- θ<sub>2</sub>) given θ1and θ2in degrees.
<br>11.	Average of N numbers read through keyboard (at run-time).
<br>12.	Average of the numbers in 3x4 matrix.
<br>13.	Plot discharging voltage across capacitor.

<br><br><b>2.	Analyze the program</b>
<br>Given the program or block of program (Matlab or Scilab), analyze the program and estimate/predict/record the output or error as the case may be. Instruct the student to justify the answer/output. 
<br>[For e.g., A=246; B=-90; C=A+B*(10/A) +100; sprintf (‘%f’, C); in Matlab]
<br>Such analysis should be carried out for all the concepts covered in this course.

Unit – II: Graded Exercises 

<b>Write the algorithm/flow-chart and code for the following problems (Assume appropriate data and units wherever necessary. Built-in functions can be used wherever necessary unless specified).</b>

<br><br>1.	Addition, subtraction and multiplication of two matrices.
<br>2.	Verify whether the given matrix is singular or non-singular and compute its inverse if applicable. 
<br>3.	Sorting of 1-D array and searching of an array/matrix. Also, list the set of numbers that obey a common condition in an array/matrix using find ( ).
<br>4.	Solve simultaneous equations (maximum of three) using Cramer’s rule. [Simultaneous equations may be obtained by applying KCL or KVL for a circuit and they can be solved for voltages or currents, respectively]
<br>5.	(a)	Show that log<sub>10</sub>(A*B)=log<sub>10</sub> A + log<sub>10</sub> B and log<sub>10</sub>(A/B)=log<sub>10</sub> A-log<sub>10</sub> B

<br>7.	Ploty1=A*sin(2πf<sub>1</sub>t), y2=B*cos(2πf<sub>2</sub>t) and y3=A*sin(2πf<sub>1</sub>t)+B*cos(2πf<sub>2</sub>t),in time and frequency (after computing DFT or FFT)  domains as subplots and infer the results.
<br>8.	Integrate and differentiate sin(x) and display the results on the same plot in different colors. Also display sin(x) on the same plot,
<br>9.	Validate <br><img src="msl1.png"/> <br>for given trigonometric functions f(x) and g(x)visually/through plots.
